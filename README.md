### TODOs:
- Use Object Detection Model to classify a person and save all the images associated for eacch profile.
- Use AI to describe the images and save their data with the profiles associated.
- Use this Image data and store it in the vector store. This data will be used in vector search and retrieval - if a specific query was initiated by a user.
- Use AI to estimate the weight and height from the image if any of them are not present in the bio.
- Use generative AI to see how you will look with the selected potential partner. Generate multiple images to have different perspectives.
- Use generative AI to see how both of thier babies and kids can look.
